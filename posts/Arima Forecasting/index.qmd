## Introduction

This project aims to perform forecasting in R using ARIMA modeling, autocorrelation functions, and ETS models. The Image below displays the final ARIMA forecast.

#### Data Preparation

To get this analysis started, the CNAGDP.csv file from the Federal Reserve of Economic Data (FRED) is read in. Some pre-processing steps involve turning it into a time series tibble and visualizing the data.

#### AutoCorrelation Function

Following this, I calculate the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) of the variable MKTGDPCNA646NWDB to analyze its correlation with its lagged values

#### Exponential Smoothing

An exponential smoothing model is fitted using the 'ets' function, and that is followed up by creating a one step forecast using the 'forecast' function.

#### ARIMA Model

Finally, it is time for the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model, created using the 'auto.arima' function.

this function is great because it automatically selects the best ARIMA model based on my data. a one-step-ahead forecast is created, and the plot of our forecast, which you have seen above, is created.
